# Line Follower RC Car with Obstacle Detection

This project focuses on building a smart **line-following RC car** that autonomously navigates along a track while avoiding obstacles in its path. The car uses a combination of **ultrasonic sensors**, **IR sensors**, **servo motors**, and **motor drivers** to follow a designated line and actively detect and avoid obstacles.

## Key Components:
- **IR Sensors**: Used to detect the line and keep the car on track.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Detects obstacles in the car's path, enabling it to avoid collisions.
- **Servo Motors**: Control the movement of the car, ensuring smooth navigation along the line.

### Goal:
The main objective of this project is to integrate these components into a cohesive system that not only follows the line but also reacts to its environment by avoiding obstacles. This makes the project a great introduction to robotics and autonomous systems.
